A Browser extension that enables dark mode on any website with smart handling of media elements and customizable settings.

![Dark Mode Switcher - Chrome Extension](https://vishwas-r.github.io/Dark-Mode-Switcher/screenshots/chrome-extension-light.png)

## Key Features

### üåì Global Theme Toggle
Apply a dark theme to all websites and tabs with a single click or keyboard shortcut. The extension intelligently inverts colors while preserving readability and usability.

### üìã Exclusion List
Maintain a list of websites that should be excluded from theme changes. Perfect for sites that already have their own dark mode or where color accuracy is important.

### üñºÔ∏è Smart Media Handling
The extension preserves the original appearance of:
- Images
- Videos
- Canvas elements
- Background images and gradients

This ensures media content remains visually accurate while the rest of the page is in dark mode.

### ‚ö° Dynamic Content Support
Using MutationObserver, the extension automatically processes new content as it loads on the page, ensuring a consistent experience even with dynamically loaded elements.

### üíæ Persistent Settings
All your preferences are saved across browser sessions, so you only need to configure the extension once.

### üé® UI Theme Toggle
Switch the extension's own user interface between light and dark themes to match your browser theme.

## Usage
